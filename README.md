#  Markdown Syntax

The dotCMS Markdown Viewtool uses Github-flavored Markdown syntax. This document describes the most commonly used markdown features using this syntax.
##  Markdown Basics

> Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to valid HTML for viewing on dotCMS. This list of examples was taken from github.com, which has popularized markdown to the point that it has become a defacto web [standard](www.google.com).

Markdown tags use simple characters and text conventions to allow the most common types of HTML formatting, without using HTML tags. Note that most markdown formatting does not require a closing tag or character.
